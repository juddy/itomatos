# itomatOS
## Debian derived distribution
### An exercise in automation and distro packaging

Ten years ago or more, itomatOS was born in Boulder, Colorado. Its origin stems from Morphix experiments ca. 2005 and continued interest and commitment to Debian.

itomatOS in its recent form sheds the demographic of yore; 2D art - essentially a desktop creation tool for 2D artists akin to what Ubuntu Studio  provides to musicians.

This distro is lean and it does behaves as I think a general-purpose Debian box should in 2018.
